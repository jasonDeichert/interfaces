# HL7 to XML Interface Transformation Demo

This project demonstrates AI-accelerated development of healthcare interfaces. It showcases a configurable transformation engine that converts HL7 v2 messages into XML format using JSON-based mapping rules - built to demonstrate the power of AI-assisted development in complex healthcare environments.

```

## Features

- **Configurable Mappings**: Define transformation rules in JSON format
- **Type-Safe Processing**: Strict typing throughout the codebase
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new field mappings and transformations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests to ensure reliability

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the transformation:
   ```bash
   python src/transformer.py
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Demo Purpose

This system demonstrates how AI can accelerate complex healthcare interface development. The demo includes realistic HL7 messages (ADT^A01 patient admissions, ORU^R01 lab results) that showcase common healthcare integration challenges - all built to show the transformative potential of AI-assisted development.

**Note**: This is a demonstration system designed to showcase AI development capabilities, not intended for production healthcare use.
